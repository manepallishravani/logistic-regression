# logistic-regression

This logistic regression example in Python will be to predict passenger survival using the titanic dataset from Kaggle.

Logistic Regression Assumptions
Any logistic regression example in Python is incomplete without addressing model assumptions in the analysis. The important assumptions of the logistic regression model include:
Target variable is binary
Predictive features are interval (continuous) or categorical
Features are independent of one another
Sample size is adequate â€“ Rule of thumb: 50 records per predictor

So, in my logistic regression example in Python, I am going to walk you through how to check these assumptions in our favorite programming language.
